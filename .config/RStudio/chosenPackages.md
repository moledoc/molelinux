# R packages

My selection of R packages and explenations:

* devtools: for creating packages
    * might need to install some system packages to resolve some dependencies.
* roxygen2: for documenting packages

* data.table: better alternative to data.frames (faster, less memory intensive)
* magrittr: piping
* tidyverse (dplyr)
* knitr
* ggplot2
* reticulate: python code in .Rmd chuncks

## Investigate/interesting

* TodoR: manage todos and other comments.
* purrr
* parallel
* foreach
